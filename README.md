omxplayer-web-controls-php
==========================
This is first experimental proof-of-concept REST service built to control omxplayer using android devices via post requests.
Written in PHP + some shell scripting.

Install it into apache to be accessible via http (just clone)

Remember to allow group write to installation directory:
chmod -R 777 .
